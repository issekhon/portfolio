            <h3>Game Description</h3>
            <p class="bodyText">
                ZER0 is a game made by a group of 4 for a university course on game design. This was our 
                second time using Unity in its 2D mode to create a short and complete game, focusing on a branching narrative 
                experience. The game follows a robot named ZER0 after he suddenly reboots in a thunderstorm and must uncover 
                what happened.

            <h3>Narrative Design</h3>
            <p class="bodyText"> 
                The initial idea for the game was to create a industrial art styled puzzle platforming game. The narrative was 
                to have a few cutscenes in key moments, with backstory told throughout the environment through diagetic 
                computer interfaces.

            </figure>
            <p class="bodyText">
                I designed this initial narrative structure was to create a foldback through gameplay, where your gameplay choices
                would affect the end story. The problem we encountered with this structure was that it only really gave the 
                illusion of choice as users actions early on didn't really have an impact towards the end of the game, only the most 
                recent chocie they made.

            </figure>
            <p class="bodyText">
                After creating a prototype in Unity I realized that I could prototype the levels rapibly by blocking them out without final
                assets, making the process a lot faster. This meant we could use a more "expensive" narrative structure without 
                foldbacks. This structure branches twice, with several levels never being seen if the player didn't take that direction. 
                While normally that would seem like a waste of resources, it gave the game a replayability that it was initially 
                lacking and created that agency that we wanted.

            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p class="bodyText">As the sole programmer for the project I was in charge of the Unity editing, script coding and 
                level implementation. The first step of this was the player character's physics. I used Unity's built in 
                rigidbody structure to create a character with weight. I then created simple block objects to use as floors
                and then added checks in C# script and 2D colliders on the player to allow it to stay on platforms.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p class="bodyText">
                After creating the character, I had to create the implementation for the levels. To do this I created prefabs of various
                kinds of platforms placed throughout the levels in accordance with sketches from our team's level designer. 
                Throughout this process, however, the scale of the actual implementation with the jumping physics for the player 
                made it clear that the levels could not be completed. I fine tuned the player attribute values and positioning of 
                the platforms to make it functional.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p class="bodyText">After completing this project I gained a greater appreciation for the cost and time required
                in game development. The challenge of the prototyping, and learning how to block out levels, made it possible to develop the levels without needing the team to be finished their assets first. This meant that I could work on the implementation while the assets for the levels were still being worked on.
