            <h3>Game Description</h3>
            <p class="bodyText">
                ZER0 is a game made by a group of 4 for a university course on game design. This was our 
                second time using Unity in its 2D mode to create a short and complete game, focusing on a branching narrative 
                experience. The game follows a robot named ZER0 after he suddenly reboots in a thunderstorm and must uncover 
                what happened.

            <h3>Narrative Design</h3>
            <p class="bodyText"> 
                The initial idea for the game was to create a industrial style puzzle platforming game. The narrative was 
                to have a few cutscenes in key moments, with backstory told throughout the environment through diagetic 
                computer interfaces.

            </figure>
            <p class="bodyText">
                The goal of this initial structure was to create a foldback narrative through gameplay, where your gameplay choices
                would affect the end story. The problem I encountered with this initial structure was that it only really gave the 
                illusion of choice as users actions early on didn't really have an impact towards the end of the game, only the most 
                recent chocies they made.

            </figure>
            <p class="bodyText">
                Analyzing the problem I realized that we could create levels more rapidly than we initially planned, so I came up
                with a structure that branched twice, with several levels never being seen if the player didn't take that direction. 
                While normally that would seem like a waste of resources, it gave the game a replayability that it was initially 
                lacking.

            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p class="bodyText">As the sole programmer for the project I was in charge of the Unity, script coding and 
                level implementation. The first step of this was the player character's physics. I used Unity's built in 
                rigidbody structure to create a character with weight. I then created simple block objects to use as floors
                and then added checks in C# script and 2D colliders on the player to allow it to stay on platforms.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p class="bodyText">
                After creating the character, I had to create the implementation for the levels. This used prefabs of various
                kinds of platforms placed throughout the levels in accordance with sketches from our team's level designer. 
                Throughout this process, however, the scale of the actual implementation with the jumping physics for the player 
                made it clear that the levels could not be completed. I fine tuned the player attribute values and positioning of 
                the platforms to make it functional.
