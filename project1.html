        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <h3>Game Description</h3>
        <p class="bodyText">
            ZER0 is a game made by a group of 4 for a university course on game design. This was our 
            second time using Unity in its 2D mode to create a short and complete game, focusing on a branching narrative 
            experience. The game follows a robot named ZER0 after he suddenly reboots in a thunderstorm and must uncover 
            what happened.
        </p>

        <h3>Story</h3>
        <p class="bodyText"> 
            The initial idea for the game was to create a industrial style puzzle platforming game. The narrative was 
            to have a few cutscenes in key moments, with backstory told throughout the environment through diagetic 
            computer interfaces.
        </p>

        <p class="bodyText">
            The goal of this initial structure was to create a foldback narrative through gameplay, where your gameplay choices
            would affect the end story. The problem I encountered with this initial structure was that it only really gave the 
            illusion of choice as users actions early on didn't really have an impact towards the end of the game, only the most 
            recent chocies they made.
        </p>

        <p class="bodyText">
            Analyzing the problem I realized that we could create levels more rapidly than we initially planned, so I came up
            with a structure that branched twice, with several levels never being seen if the player didn't take that direction. 
            While normally that would seem like a waste of resources, it gave the game a replayability that it was initially 
            lacking.
