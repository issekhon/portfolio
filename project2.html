        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <h3>Game Description</h3>
        <p class="bodyText">
            Ant Commander is a reimagining of a 2D paltforming game called <a class="inText" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov0fswkheBw">
            Antlion</a>. The goal of the project was to redesign it using a mixture of "fun keys" to create a compelling experience for a 
            particular type of player. 
            The team created a challenging bullet hell game with energy managment mechanics from games like DarkSouls, and focused on
            boss mechanic theming.

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p class="bodyText"> 
            Ant commander's original idea was going to be a boss-rush style game where players go through a series of bosses one
            after another, aquiring new items along the way to improve their abilities that would feed in to the way they 
            take down the next one.

        <p class="bodyText">
            The game was to be strategic and fast paced. Players would have to choose between firing or movement as 
            both would drain their energy.
        </p>
        <img src="img/antCommanderPrototype.png" alt="physical prototype">
        <p class="bodyText">
            After creating a rapid physical prototype and playtesting the strategy elements of the game, we noticed the 
            strategy element was not really working. The grid style was too restrictive to the player, not giving them enough
            room or time to strategize. 
            Some bosses would teleport when bullets were heading there way, but we didn't put enough limitations on the firing based on
            how slow players could fire at that point, so the boss would constantly teleport out of the way. Our solution was to expand the scale of
            the game and make players faster and bosses would have phases where they could not be killed or would teleport 
            a lot more.
        </p>
        


        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p class="bodyText">For this project, I did all of the scripting and implementation within Unity. The challenge here was that this was my first time working with Unity. I was unfamiliar with the editor and the design document that our team created had some complex mechanics in it, like compelx fire effects with their own colliders. To overcome this I did some research on of Unity on my own to learn how to create weapons and projectiles. Doing this i learned about a lot of the editor properties that are on the right side, as well as scripting in C# to allow for the complex results of collisions.
