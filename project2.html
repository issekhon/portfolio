        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <h3>Game Description</h3>
        <p class="bodyText">
            Ant Commander is a reimagining of a 2D paltforming game called <a class="inText" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov0fswkheBw">
            Antlion</a>. The goal of the project was to redesign it using a mixture of "fun keys" to create a compelling experience. 
            The team created a challenging bullet hell game with energy managment mechanics from games like DarkSouls, and focused on
            boss mechanic theming.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p class="bodyText"> 
            Ant commander's original idea was going to be a boss-rush style game where players go through a series of bosses one
            after another, aquiring new items along the way to improve their abilities.

        <p class="bodyText">
            The game was to be a strategic, fast paced game where players would have to choose between firing or movement as 
            both would drain their energy.

        <p class="bodyText">
            After creating a rapid physical prototype and playtesting the strategy elements of the game, we noticed the 
            strategy element was not really working. The cause of this was that the grid style was too restrictive for the boss mechanics. 
            Some bosses would teleport when bullets were heading there way, but we didn't put enough limitations on the firing based on
            how slow players could fire at that point, so the boss would constantly teleport. Our solution was to expand the scale of
            the game.
